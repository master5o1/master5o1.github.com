<h3>About</h3>
Hi, I'm Jason.<br /><br />
I was born in Switzerland back in 1989, but I've lived in New Zealand since I was two.<br /><br />
I enjoy hacking bits of code around in various languages.  I have experience programming using PHP, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, C# and Bash.<br /><br />
I like skiing and snowboarding and I've been down at Mt. Ruapehu having fun since 2003.<br />
