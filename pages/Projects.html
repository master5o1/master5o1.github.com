	<img src="images/Tartarus.png" style="float: right;" alt="Tartarus" />
	Tartarus: The After Effect is a community website and forum branched from SmileCity.<br />
	<br />
	I administrate and webmaster the website on behalf of the owners.<br />
	<br />
	The website consists of a blog, using WordPress and a forum using bbPress 2.<br />
	Most of my WordPress plugins have been to enhance the features of Tartarus.<br />

	bbPress Mobile is a mobile interface to the bbPress forum software.  It utilises the XML-RPC api and uses the XML-RPC for PHP library.<br />
	<br />
	I created bbPress Mobile for my Tartarus project.<br />

	<h4>Pirate Party of New Zealand</h4>
	With a fair bit of personal interest in the movement, I decided to help The Pirate Party of New Zealand by setting up, designing and partially managing the site.<br />
	<br />
	The website consists of three parts, the site, the forum and the wiki.<br />
